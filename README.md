# nob for Neocities 🐱
nob is a neocities-oriented blog manager and static site generator. It is
really easy to use and fast. It is intended to be used along with
[Neocities CLI](https://neocities.org/cli).

## Installation
Download a binary for your operating system from the
[releases page](https://github.com/nanavortex/nob/releases/)
and move it to a convenient directory (for example, `~/.local/bin` if you are
using Linux)

Finally, just run `nob` from your terminal and that's it!

## Features
* Neocities-oriented
* Cross-platform
* Simple templating system
* You can write your posts in Markdown
* Support for RSS
* No theming system. You just use any CSS stylesheet you like and works.

## How to use nob
The [wiki](https://github.com/nanavortex/nob/wiki) has more information
about this. Alternatively, run `nob help --more` from your terminal.

## To do
* Refactor some portions of the code
* Auto delete HTML file if missing draft?
* GitHub actions (I don't understand how it works yet)
